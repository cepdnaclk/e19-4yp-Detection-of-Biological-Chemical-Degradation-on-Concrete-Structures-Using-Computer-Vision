# DETECTION OF BIOLOGICAL DEGRADATION OF CONCRETE STRUCTURES USING COMPUTER VISION
___


Concrete structures are often exposed to biological degradation caused by algae, fungi, and moss, which can weaken their integrity over time. Traditional inspection methods are labor-intensive and subjective. This project aims to develop a computer vision-based system to automatically detect and classify biological degradation on concrete surfaces. By leveraging deep learning techniques and image processing, the system will provide a more efficient and accurate assessment of structural health, helping to optimize maintenance efforts.
